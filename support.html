How to use Track Trimmer Pro:

Click "Browse" to choose your input file/folder.

Click "Browse to choose your output destination. ** Note ** You should always choose a different destination folder from your input folder as the program will try to save the file in the same place which may overwrite the original file! Otherwise, you can add a prefix or suffix to all your files at the bottom of tghe screen.

Process Settings

Set Markers: Use the up/down arrows or type in a manual time entry to define your Start and End points. You can increment time by 10ths of a second.

Set the fade in/out times if desired

Audio Enhancements

You can optionally enable Normalization to balance volume.

Choose Format

Select your desired output format (MP3, WAV, FLAC, etc.) and bitrate.

You can also chose your desired Audio Quality Settings

Add any prefix or suffix to your filename. For example, if you are creating 30 second clips of your audio files, you could put _30second as your suffix, and all your files will be saved with that suffix. You can use these fields to differentiate your processed files from their originals.

Process:

Click the "Process" button. Your trimmed files will be saved to your chosen destination folder.
